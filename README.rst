==============================

Alm Lab's version_.

.. _version: https://github.com/almlab/dbotu3

Introduction
------------

*dbotu3* is a new implementation of Sarah Preheim's dbOTU_ algorithm.  The
scope is narrower, the numerical comparisons are faster, and the interface is
more user-friendly.

.. _dbOTU: http://aem.asm.org/content/79/21/6593.long

Read the documentation_ for:

- a guide to getting started,
- an explanation of the algorithm, and
- the API reference.

.. _documentation: http://dbotu3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

You can also read our new paper_ for more technical details about the
algorithm.  The Alm Lab website_ also has a short page with information.

Installation
------------

dbotu3 is on PyPi_ and can be installed with pip:

.. _PyPi: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dbotu

.. code-block::

    pip install dbotu

dbotu3 is also on conda_ and can be installed as follows:

.. _conda: https://anaconda.org/cduvallet/dbotu

.. code-block::

    conda install -c cduvallet -c conda-forge dbotu

For `QIIME 2`_ users, dbotu3 is also available as a plugin_.

.. _plugin: https://github.com/cduvallet/q2-dbotu
.. _`QIIME 2`: https://qiime2.org/

Requirements
------------

- Numpy, SciPy, BioPython_, Pandas_
- Levenshtein_

.. _BioPython: http://biopython.org
.. _Pandas: http://pandas.pydata.org
.. _Levenshtein: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-Levenshtein

Version history
---------------

- 1.1: Corrected error where sequence IDs that could be read as integers would not be found in the table
- 1.2: Python 2 compatibility, tox test framework, warnings for improperly-formatted sequence count tables
- 1.2.1: Added setup requirements
- 1.3.0: Improved OTU file header. Split the log file into a debug and progress log.
- 1.4.0: Made an improvement to the Levenshtein-based genetic dissimilarity metric.
- 1.4.1: Account for pandas API change to ``MultiIndex``
- 1.5.0: Added the restart and rep seq scripts
- 1.5.1: New function for Qiime2 compatibility

To-do
-----

- Testing for the restart scripts
- Better coverage for unit tests
